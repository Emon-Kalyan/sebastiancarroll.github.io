# Kaizen and Compound Interest

## Outline
Standard business improvement - People tell other people what to do and you get some business improvement. This is like standard interest
Kaizen - improvement is the responsibility of everyone. All improve all the time. Thus it is like compound interest where the rewards can be reinvested.
Relating - compound interest is amazing and worth doing with even modest expected returns -5-10%. People are even more impressive that this and can expect anywhere from 25,50, even hundreds of percent increases with small changes. These can then be reinvested.
Even with Kaizen we don't really get to compound interest because we aren't continuously reinvesting the time saved
Need to be improving with learning and by doing that then the interest adds up and the metaphor makes sense
This is the basis of a learning organisation

## Improvement Initiatives
Standard improvement initiatives are where an external team identifies some area of the business that could be improved. They are generally then assigned to this to make that improvement. Usually, there is some expected benefit and some expected cost, where the project will be approved if the benefit is higher than the cost plus some risk margin. Pretty standard stuff

When I think about this the idea of investment interest comes to mind, where some money or principle is invested with some expected gains.  In our improvement case, we invest some time and money with the hope of helping employees in a way that makes them more productive. The project is conducted once and then the affected employees should be more productive going forward.

I see this case like interest with no replacement because the rewards gained (higher productivity) are not then being reinvested, they are just being extracted as margins

## What is Kaizen?
Kaizen is about always striving to reduce waste and increase productivity and makes sense to me and to a lot of other people. Who doesn't understand that if we reduce waste we can save money?
When you practice Kaizen it focuses you on minimising the improvement cycle and eventually minimising it as much as possible.

It has helped Toyota company become a world leader. **TODO: Add reference here**

## Investing your time
Lots of people understand how interest works. It's fairly simple: you invest some money and receive that money back, plus some percent after some time. There is some risk built into the system here where you might lose your principle and the interest if the borrower doesn't honour the loan. Usually the higher the risk, the higher the interest rate.

This serves as a nice metaphor when assessing improvement initiatives. It costs you some time to stop and sharpen the saw (which is the investment) and you hope that this will return some interest. **TODO: Feels like something more should go here**

This is the argument you will have to make to get training for example, how much will it cost (fees + lost time) and how much is the benefit? If the benefit + margin for risk is greater than the cost then this will usually be approved.

## Compounding Interest
Almost everyone understands compound interest. It has been described as The eighth wonder of the modern world and powers much of the modern economy especially banking and finance. For those who don't know it is a fairly simple concept. I revolves around lending or investing money (the principle) and then earning interest on that principle. The magic happens when you start re-investing the interest earned and the amount earned starts growing exponentially. The earnings increase with each cycle even though the interest rate itself stays constant. For example earning 1% annually for a decade is not 1% times ten (or 10%), its 1% to the power of ten (or 10.45%)!

Here is a graph showing the exponential growing power of compound interest.

Pretty amazing right? Your financial pot just keeps growing faster and faster!

## Compounding Improvement
The difference between normal investment and compounding investment is staggering. This is exactly the same difference as there is between normal investment in learning and continuous improvement.
Normal investment in learning assumes that you just keep working 100% but with the extra bonus in productivity however Kaizen advocates keeping the amount of time free for continuous learning and then reinvesting the time savings back into more improvement.

## People are not machines
They are not. Financial returns from loans are usually very well known in advance. You'll get 3-6% year and year out with very low risk. People are much more variable than that but the gains are also potentially much higher. A well oiled team with a focus on improvement could see returns of orders of magnitudes higher than standard interest rates. Something as simple as an MVP could see your idea efficiently validated at a thousandth of the cost of a full project (maybe a millionth)

However I have been trying to convince people that continuous improvement is a good idea and it is always hard to explain. There is a big disconnect between what is possible. I think many people don't see the connection, when they see the numbers of proof fall victim to the 'Snowflake' logical fallacy - I'm so unique this problem could never apply to me.
**TODO: Possibly off track here. Maybe talk more about the tradeoffs that have to made as part of Kaizen. Ie slowing down now to invest time to to improve later**
Basically it is difficult as people have to make a tradeoff - how much to we stop to 'sharpen the saw now'? Its a difficult question however one that I don't have any problem answering now. Why? Because Kaizen is viewed like interest. You put up some capital now to invest and want to know how long it will take to pay off. E.g. I think many people approach the calcualtion liek so: If we invest 10% of our time to Kaizen and expect a 5% improvement on the remaining 90% of available effort then our investment will pay off in about 3.2 years **TODO: Get correct number**. And then after that it is all compounding gains. From the graph you can see that after 8 years of Kaizen you have an extra years worth of value out of your team and after 15 years you have an extra 5.4 years value from the team! Those numbers are pretty phenominal but aren't very convincing really. The time scales are too long. Managers and markets want things now and arent willing to wait for years. However the extra catch here is that people are not like money. Interest rates with people are not set and can fluctuate wildly. As the BBC Kanban report shows is that 5% improvement is a very concervative estimate. Its possible to see improvements of 25, 50 or even 100%. With numbers like these possible and compound interest included its possible to gain lightning fast increases which are being left on the table.



**TODO: Get actual definitions about what is Kaizen vs continous improvement.**

**TODO: Talk about how compound interest is usually less than say 12-13%. For loans etc and maybe 20% for businesses. However to team improvements and stuff can often see 25, 50 even 100%+ improvements. WTF that is huge!!**

**TODO: Should probably start with Kaizen. Then say its like Interest. Then say what people don't understand is that it is actually compound interest. Nice!**
